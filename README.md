# Quantum Information

This is a [course at the University of Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/semester-planning?id=264654), given by James Wootton of [IBM Research](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-JWO).

**Regarding the current health situation, keep track of the [university](https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/Coronavirus.html) and [cantonal](https://www.coronavirus.bs.ch/) guidelines. An online alternative will be provided for all lectures. Information will be sent by email.**

The course begins on 22nd Feb 2022 and will have weekly lectures and exercises.

## Course Content

Quantum information theory is the basis of multiple emerging technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum crypotography. It allows us to understand how quantum effects in physical systems may be harnessed for new forms of information processing. The course will also feature some hands on experience with quantum technology, via the open-source Qiskit framework for quantum computing.

## Course Text

The course will be based on the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html).

## Lectures

In-person lectures will be held when possible. However, since the lectures will follow the same format as in 2021, pre-recorded lectures will be available for all who cannot attend for any reason.

## Exercises

Some exercises will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These can be run locally by installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). They can also be run online without any installation using the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab). When you are on the files menu of the lab, you can click on the 'upload file' icon to upload notebooks.

The easiest way to to download the exercises is to download the whole repository using [this link](https://github.com/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/archive/master.zip).

The TAs will determine the format for the exercise classes.

## Exam/Final Project

In 2020 and 2021, the course had a final project instead of an exam. Whether we'll do the same in 2022, or have an exam instead, has not yet been decided.
