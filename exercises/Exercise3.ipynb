    "(a) Write a function to create Qisit circuits for linear repetition codes, for arbitrary code distance `d`, number of syndrome measurement rounds `T` and for both a stored logical `0` and logical `1`. Remember that, for the final set of syndrome measurememnts, there is no need for the `reset` gate after the final measurement. So leave this out in your circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Transpile these to the backend `FakeSherbrooke` for distances from `d=3` to `d=55` and with `T=1`. This should be done such that the number of two-qubit gates prior to transpilation should be equal to the number of two-qubit gates after transpilation. Note that the native two-qubit gate for Sherbrooke is the `'ecr'` gate. The backend can be obtained with\n",

    "In the lecture [Decoding 2: Correcting Errors](https://github.com/quantumjim/qec_lectures/blob/main/lecture-2.ipynb) we saw Qiskit QEC create a decoding graph for a Qiskit QEC repetition code. In this exercise, you will create the same thing for your own repetition code.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write a function that can process the output of your repetition code, to find syndrome changes and create nodes for your decoding graph. For this you can draw heavy inspiration from [Decoding 1: Running Circuits and Interpreting Outputs](https://github.com/quantumjim/qec_lectures/blob/main/lecture-1.ipynb). To demonstrate your function, apply it to a few example output strings that result in both normal nodes and boundary nodes, and explain why it does what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Using this, insert all possible single Paulis into your circuit to see what nodes result. Using `rustworkx` or `networkx`, create a graph in which edges link nodes that were found to result from the same inserted Paulis. In the end you should create an image such as the following one in [Decoding 2: Correcting Errors](https://github.com/quantumjim/qec_lectures/blob/main/lecture-2.ipynb) (but the numbers don't need to be the same).\n",
