These will have lower probabilities for noise than the level-0 qubits, but maybe not as low as we require. We can then use the level-1 qubits as if they were physical qubits, using them to encode $n/9^2$ level-2 qubits. This procedure can then be continued as many times as required, with the level-$(l-1)$ qubits always used as the physical qubits of the Shor codes that encode the level-$l$ qubits.\n",

The level-1 error rate is that of the logical qubits of the 9 qubit code: $p_x^{(1)}=P_x$. Use your result from question 1(b) to show that $p_x^{(l-1)}$ and $p_x^{(l)}$ are related by\n",
